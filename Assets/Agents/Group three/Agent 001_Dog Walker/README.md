## AGENT 001: Dog Walker
* Geometrical Constraints

>Physical size is 0.45 m × 1.70 m × 0.15 m. Additionally, it has a 1-3 m buffer radius for dogs given the possibility for sporadic movement.

* Turning Radius

>Dog walkers can make 360 degree spot turn so there is no turning radius.

* Acceleration/Deceleration

>Dog walker reaches 2 m/s in 2 seconds. At 2 m/s, the dog walkers stopping distance is 1.5 m.

* Obstacle Interaction

>Dog walkers will steer by roadblock when walking their dogs.

* Trajectory

>Dog walkers follow sidewalk, typically staying close to the grassy area to relieve their dogs. A dog walker will stop waiting for their dogs playing in grass at any time.

* Pathways

>Dog walkers typically follow the path of other pedestrians, however they are more prone to venture into grassy areas to relieve their pets.
