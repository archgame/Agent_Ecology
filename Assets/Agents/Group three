## AGENT 001: Dog Walker
* Geometrical Constraints

>Physical size is 0.45 m × 1.70 m × 0.15 m. Additionally, it has a 1-3 m buffer radius for dogs given the possibility for sporadic movement.

* Turning Radius

>Dog walkers can make 360 degree spot turn so there is no turning radius.

* Acceleration/Deceleration

>Dog walker reaches 2 m/s in 2 seconds. At 2 m/s, the dog walkers stopping distance is 1.5 m.

* Obstacle Interaction

>Dog walkers will steer by roadblock when walking their dogs.

* Trajectory

>Dog walkers follow sidewalk, typically staying close to the grassy area to relieve their dogs. A dog walker will stop waiting for their dogs playing in grass at any time.

* Pathways

>Dog walkers typically follow the path of other pedestrians, however they are more prone to venture into grassy areas to relieve their pets.

## AGENT 002: Scooter
* Geometrical Constraints

>The size of a scooter is 107 cm long and 117 cm high and riders need a 1.5 m × 2.5 m buffer area to avoid danger.

* Turning Radius

>The turning radius of a scooter is 1 m. 

* Acceleration/Deceleration

>Scooter reaches a maximum speed of 24 km/h in 4 seconds. At 24 km/h the breaking distance of a scooter is 4 m.

* Obstacle Interaction

>Scooters will stop for moving vehicles with a larger mass, but will weave through stopped vehicles. And riders will stop when they encounter pedestrians on the sidewalk.

* Trajectory

>In most cases, scooters follow roads and move in the outermost lane but sometimes people ride scooters on sidewalk for their own safety.

* Pathways

>Scooters always try to keep distance with vehicles and pedestrians.

## AGENT 003: Ice Cream Truck
* Geometrical Constraints

>The length of vehicle is 4.8 m, width is 1.9 m, and the height is 2.9 m. The path requires a minimum width of 2.3 m.

* Turning Radius

>A minimum inner radius of 3.5 m and minimum outer radius of 5.85 m should be provided.

* Acceleration/Deceleration

>The vehicle reaches 30 km/h in 9 seconds. At 30 km/h, the vehicle's stopping distance is 32 m.

* Obstacle Interaction

>Ice cream trucks will prepare for steering by obstacles from a long distance.

* Trajectory

>Ice cream trucks follow roads, typically staying close to sidewalk and preparing to park at anytime.

* Pathways

>Ice cream trucks typically go around in a neighborhood or leisure areas, play certain music to attract customers and pull up when someone wave their hands.
