## AGENT jaywalker
* Geometrical Constraints

<<<<<<< HEAD
>jaywalker Example: physical size is about 0.5M in long diameter and 0.25M in short diameter of ellipse shape. And the height is about 1.75M.

* Turning Radius

>jaywalker Example: 70% of jaywalkers will walk linearly acrossing the road, 20% of them will do diagonally, the rest of it will be like wandering acrossing the street, and their turning radius is 4-8M.

* Acceleration/Deceleration

>jaywalker Example: The crosswalking speed is 3.1 mph on averga, pedestrains of different age will add or reduce 20% speed from 3.1 mph.

* Obstacle Interaction

>jaywalker Example: When cars approach jaywalkers, they speed up for 50-100%.

* Trajectory

>jaywalker Example:70% of jaywalkers across the road vertically, 20% of jaywalkers across the road diagonally, the rest across the road randomly, like curvy path.

* Pathways

>jaywalker Example: The jaywalkers mainly halt in the path way, or let say they start and end from the pathways.

The crosswalking speed is 3.1 mph on averga, pedestrains of different age will add or reduce 20% speed from 3.1 mph.
70% of jaywalkers across the road vertically, 20% of jaywalkers across the road diagonally, the rest across the road randomly, like curvy path.
However, when cars approach jaywalkers, they speed up for 50-100%.
