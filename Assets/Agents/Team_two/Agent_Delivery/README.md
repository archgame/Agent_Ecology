## AGENT Delivery
* Geometrical Constraints

<<<<<<< HEAD
>Delivery Example: The specification of delivery refer from Fedex truck, smaller model as following- 4.8M* 2M* 2.2M

* Turning Radius

>Delivery Example: The turning radius of delivery is typically 5M+5.5M/2, which is the regulation in building code in general.

* Acceleration/Deceleration

>Delivery Example: The speed is 25-35 mph when transporting, but when it is about to stop, it decrease to 5-10 mph.

* Obstacle Interaction

>Delivery Example: It will fully stop when facing obstacle, but if the obstcle is not moving a way, the delivery will take a detour in the speed of 5-10 mph. While got rid of obstacle, the speed resumes.

* Trajectory

>Delivery Example: Basically it runs on normal car way, but when it is unloading cargos, it will halt in the trun lane or just on the street parking space for about 10-20 minutes.

* Pathways

>Delivery Example: OPTIONAL. When the delievery is halting for unloading cargos, the driver get out of car to pass through the pathway slowly, as slow as 2 mph.
=======
The specification of delivery refer from Fedex truck, smaller model.
The length of the truck is 192", the speed is 25-35 mph.
Its behaviors will be temporary parking in the middle of road or on the side of road based on how many lanes in the road.
Its halt time is from 5 min to 10 min.
