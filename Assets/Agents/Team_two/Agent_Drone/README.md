## AGENT Drone
* Geometrical Constraints

<<<<<<< HEAD
>Drone Example: Referring from DJI MAVIC 2 PRO, the physical size is 0.4M in diameter and height.

* Turning Radius:

>Drone Example: It can turn sheer, or go oppsite direction as random behaviors. Normally it turns 90 degree when it is passing through buildings.

* Acceleration/Deceleration:

>Drone Example: Average speed 44 mph, when it arrived at designed location, it will halt in that particular locations for 2-5 minutes.

* Obstacle Interaction: 

>Drone Example: The obstacle for drone it drone itself. When it face the other drone, one drone will stop, and the other drone will take detour and move left/right for 1M then resume their fly.

* Trajectory

>Drone Example: The drones will go through the building(won't go higher than buildings), so they are drifting on the top of roads and sidewalks. The height in air is all same as 10M for evey drone. 
                It can only go as far as 4.3M based on spec limitation, when meet the limitation, it lands.

* Pathways

>Drone Example: The pathways are where drone launch and land. Then locations are randomly distributed.
=======
There will be five models of drone, their specifications as following.
1.HUBSAN H111: Size 3",Average speed 7 mph, active range 150 ft
2.DJI MAVIC AIR: Size 10",Average speed 42.5 mph, active range 2 mile
3.DJI MAVIC 2 PRO: Size 15",Average speed 44 mph, active range 4.3 mile
4.DJI PHANTOM 4 PRO V2.0: Size 20",Average speed 45 mph, active range 4.3 mile
5.DJI INSPIRE 2: Size 24",Average speed 58 mph, active range 4.3 mile

The moving bevaviors are hovering mostly accompanied with short distance liner movement, the overall moving distance will not exceed its spec limitation.
