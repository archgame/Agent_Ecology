* Geometrical Constraints

>Drone Example: physical size is between 3" - 24" radius. Additionally, it has a 4' buffer radius for pedestrians given the possibility for sporadic movement.

* Turning Radius

>Car Example: While at full speed, the vehicle has a turning radius of 10.82 m. While driving slowly the turning radius is 1 m.

* Acceleration/Deceleration

>Motorcycle Example: At full acceleration, the bike reaches 100 km/h in 3 seconds. at 32 km/h, the bike's stopping distance is 12 m, while at 112 km/h the bike's stopping distance is 96 m.

* Obstacle Interaction

>Bike Example: Bicycles will stop for moving vehicles with a larger mass, but will weave through stopped vehicles and moving pedestrians.

* Trajectory

>Bus Example: Buses follow roads, typically staying to towards the outermost lane. A bus will pull over and stop at bus stops with waiting pedestrians or at a departure point designated by a rider.

* Pathways

>Dog Walker Example: Dog Walkers typically follow the path of other pedestrians, however they are more prone to venture into grassy areas to relieve their pets.
