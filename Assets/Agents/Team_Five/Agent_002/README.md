## AGENT 002 - Roller Skates
* Geometrical Constraints

>Roller Skates: physical size is same as of a human - 0.45 - 0.60m. About 0.45 might be required on each side to extend the arms to balance. 
Total diameter of the circle would be about 1.8m. Additionally, a buffer space of 0.30 - 0.45m would be required all around.

* Turning Radius

>Roller Skates: While at full speed, roller skates have a turning radius of 1.0m. 
While moving slowly, turning radius is 0.45m.

* Acceleration/Deceleration

>Roller Skates: At full acceleration, roller skates reach 10 m/h in 10 seconds.
At 10 m/h, the stopping distance is 0.6m, while at 30 m/h the stopping distance is 3.0m.

* Obstacle Interaction

>Roller Skates: Roller skates will stop for moving vehicles with a larger mass, but will weave through stopped vehicles and moving pedestrians.

* Trajectory

>Roller Skates: Roller Skates follow pavements. A roller skater moves similarly to humans, stopping at traffic lights and crossing only using crosswalks.
