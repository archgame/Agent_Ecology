* Geometrical Constraints

>Roller Skates: physical size is same as of a human - 18'-36'. About 18" might be required on each side to extend the arms to balance. 
Total diameter of the circle would be about 72". Additionally, a buffer space of 18"-24" would be required all around.

* Turning Radius

>Roller Skates: While at full speed, roller skates have a turning radius of 7'. 
While moving slowly, turning radius is 4'

* Acceleration/Deceleration

>Roller Skates: At full acceleration, roller skates reach 10 m/h in 10 seconds.
At 10 m/h, the stopping distance is 2', while at 30 m/h the stopping distance is 10'.

* Obstacle Interaction

>Roller Skates: Roller skates will stop for moving vehicles with a larger mass, but will weave through stopped vehicles and moving pedestrians.

* Trajectory

>Roller Skates: Roller Skates follow pavements. A roller skater moves similarly to humans, stopping at traffic lights and crossing only using crosswalks.

* Pathways

>Roller Skates: ??
>Dog Walker Example: Dog Walkers typically follow the path of other pedestrians, however they are more prone to venture into grassy areas to relieve their pets.
