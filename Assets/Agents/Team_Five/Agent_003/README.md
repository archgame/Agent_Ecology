## AGENT 003 Tram
* Geometrical Constraints

>Tram: physical size is up to 70m (usually around 20m) X 2.4m''.

* Turning Radius

>Tram: minimum turning radius of 25m for a regular 20m long tram.

* Acceleration/Deceleration

>Tram: Regular speed in an urban environment 40-50 kph, the distance a tram needs in order to stop is around 25m for a speed of 40 kph (doudle the distance a regular bus needs in order to stop).

* Obstacle Interaction

>Tram: Trams operate on a designated railway which practiacally means that they do not have to interact with obstacles. Due to their slow deceleration they are also safer not to.

* Trajectory

>Tram: Tram routes start from a depatrure point, stop at designated stations to pick-up or drop passengers and in a terminal when they most probably loop from to follow the same root again

* Pathways

>Tram: Tram is a set-track means of transportation, which means that it only moves on a designated railway  and is not allowed to deviate from it.
