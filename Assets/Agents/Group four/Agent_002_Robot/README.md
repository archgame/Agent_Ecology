## AGENT Robot_Starship
* Geometrical Constraints

>Physical size is between 0.28m ¨C 0.34m radius. Additionally, it has a 1.2m buffer radius for pedestrians given the possibility for sporadic movement.

* Random Scale
> xmin = 0.9; xmax = 1.1;
  ymin = 0.9; ymax = 1.1;
  zmin = 0.9; zmax = 1.1;

* Turning Radius

>While at full speed, the robot has a turning radius of 1.46 m. While driving slowly the turning radius is 0 m.

* Acceleration/Deceleration

>At full acceleration, the robot reaches 5.76 km/h in 2 seconds. at 5.76 km/h, the robot's stopping distance is 1 m.

* Obstacle Interaction

>Robot will stop for moving vehicles and moving pedestrians, but will weave through stopped vehicles and stopped pedestrians.

* Trajectory

>Robot will run from a transportation hub to a shop to bring food a customer order. And it will go toward the customer¡¯s location. Robot will just follow sidewalks. And robot will follow crosswalk to go across a road. A robot will stop to wait for traffic light turning green. A robot will pull over and stop at bicycle parking lots in front of the front door. It will go back to transportation hub after a customer takes out food.

* Pathways

>Robot will go back to transportation hub to charge if battery is too low to reach the destination.
