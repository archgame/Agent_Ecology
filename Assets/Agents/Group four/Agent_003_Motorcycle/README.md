## AGENT Motorcycle
* Geometrical Constraints

>Physical size is between 0.41m ¨C 1.06m radius. Additionally, it has a 2.50m buffer radius for pedestrians given the possibility for sporadic movement.

* Turning Radius

>While at full speed, the motorcycle has a turning radius of 13.5 m. While driving slowly the turning radius is 1.8 m.

* Acceleration/Deceleration

>At full acceleration, the motorcycle reaches 100 km/h in 3 seconds. at 32 km/h, the motorcycle's stopping distance is 12 m, while at 112 km/h the motorcycle's stopping distance is 96 m.

* Obstacle Interaction

>Motorcycle will slow down for moving vehicles with a larger mass, and stop for moving pedestrians. But it will weave through stopped vehicles and stopped pedestrians. 

* Trajectory

>Motorcycle follow roads. 

* Pathways

>Motorcycle will overtake other slower motor vehicles which is in front of it from the left side.
