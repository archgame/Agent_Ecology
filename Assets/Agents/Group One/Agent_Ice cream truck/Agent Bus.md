## AGENT BUS
* Geometrical Constraints

>physical size is about: length: 39’2”; width: 8’4”; height: 9’10”.

* Turning Radius

>A typical inner turning radius is 21.5 feet. At its tightest turning angle, the rear overhang of the back bumper extends out to 43.3 feet.

* Acceleration/Deceleration

>Motorcycle Example: At full acceleration, the bike reaches 100 km/h in 3 seconds. at 32 km/h, the bike's stopping distance is 12 m, while at 112 km/h the bike's stopping distance is 96 m.

* Obstacle Interaction

>Bike Example: Bicycles will stop for moving vehicles with a larger mass, but will weave through stopped vehicles and moving pedestrians.

* Trajectory

>Bus Example: Buses follow roads, typically staying to towards the outermost lane. A bus will pull over and stop at bus stops with waiting pedestrians or at a departure point designated by a rider.
