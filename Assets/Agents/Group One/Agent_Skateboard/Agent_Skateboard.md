## AGENT Skateboard
* Geometrical Constraints

> physical size: width 7.87', length 30', height 3.94'

* Turning Radius

> While at full speed, the skateboard has a turning radius of 2 m. While driving slowly the turning radius is 0.5 m.

* Acceleration/Deceleration

>The anual speed is 2.8m/s, and the stop distance is 0.8m. at full acceleration, it reaches 4.2m/s, the stop distance is 2m.

* Obstacle Interaction

>skateboard will weave through pedestrians on the sidewalk, but will stop for moving vehicles with a larger mass on the road. 

* Trajectory

>skateboard's trajectory is linear, and will start at the bus station, stay at the open area, and final end at home.

* Pathways

>skateboard prefer at running on the road if there is less than 5 five vehicles around, but if there are many vehicles, children prefer to play the skateboard on the sidewalk.
