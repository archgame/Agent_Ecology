## AGENT school children
* Geometrical Constraints

>a child's physical size is about 12' radius. And his movement size is about 24' radius. Additionally, it has more area size if there is a group contains 2~4 children.


* Acceleration/Deceleration

> a child walk faster at 1.2 m/s, a group of children walk slower at 0.9 m/s

* Obstacle Interaction

>School children will stop for moving vehicles in the intersection when they walk , but will weave through stopped vehicles and moving pedestrians on the playboard.

* Trajectory

>school children typically find their school bus and ride on the skateboard to go home or play.

* Pathways

>school children walk on the sidewalk to take on the bus, play on the skateboard on the open space.
